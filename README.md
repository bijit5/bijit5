## 🚀 What I Do

I'm a DevOps Engineer specializing in cloud-native infrastructure on AWS. I have hands-on experience building and automating production-grade systems — from CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes clusters to full GitOps workflows.

I'm currently open to **full-time DevOps / Cloud Engineer roles** as well as **freelance and contract engagements** with startups and product teams globally.

**Core capabilities:**
- Set up production-grade **Kubernetes clusters on AWS EKS** from scratch
- Build **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions / Jenkins) that automate 90%+ of deployments
- Implement **GitOps workflows** with ArgoCD for zero-touch, self-healing deployments
- Manage infrastructure as code using **Terraform** — repeatable, version-controlled, auditable
- Harden pipelines with **security scanning** (Trivy, SonarQube) and RBAC policies
